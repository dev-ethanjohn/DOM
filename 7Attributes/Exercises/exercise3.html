<!-- /*
    1. Create a new HTML file that has the following
       Elements in it:
       - <head> with a <title> with some text in it
       - <body> with:
            - <h1> tag with some text
            - <script> tag for some code (last element
                in the document)

    2. In the <script> tag write some code that will
       change the colour of the <h1> tag's text to
       blue, then to red switching every 1 second. Use a
       "setInterval" to do this.

    3. Open up your file in your Browser and open the
       dev tools alongside it as well.
    
    4. Verify the changes in the DOM/Elements tab as well
       as visually in the UI
